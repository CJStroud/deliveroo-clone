Practice project using create react app and aphrodite CSS in JS library for
styling.

Most of the interaction elements are not implemented yet, this is mostly just the
responsive UI at the moment.

## Why?

I was looking for something to make, I was hungry and thought
Deliveroo's site look pretty cool. So this is my attempt to replicate it.

## Setup locally

- Clone the repo
- Install node modules
- yarn start

Will be running on http://localhost:3000/
